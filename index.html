				<h1>Hi, I'm Elisa !</h1>

				<p> 
				My name is Elisa LEMÉNAGER, I am 19 years old and I live in a ski resort called Méribel. I am currently a first year student at ESSEC Business School in Cergy. My three main interests are my family, sports and traveling.

				<h2>My Family</h2>
				<p>
					I love my family. I live with both my parents and my little brother in Méribel, a ski resort in the french Apls 🏔. We also have a lovely cat called Mistache 🐱.
					My brother's name is Hugo, he is 12 and does snowboarding 🏂. He also enjoys playing video games with his friends 🎮.
					My parents have two restaurants; One in the village, accessible by foot, ski, bus or car and the other one on the ski slopes, only accessible by ski.
					Here are the links to their websites :

				<h2>Sports</h2>
				<p>
					I love doing sports. I was lucky enough to be able to practice different sports from a very young age. I started with downhill skiing ⛷, from the age of 2 to 10. At the same time, I also did figure skating ⛸. Then, in CM2, I stopped downhill skiing to switch to cross-country skiing. I spent 7 years doing it, including 2 years of biathlon. When there no longer was snow, I ran 🏃🏽‍♀️, hiked in the mountains 🥾, did weight training 🏋🏽‍♀️, mountain biking 🚵🏽‍♀️, road biking 🚴🏽‍♀️, swimming 🏊🏽‍♀️ and wheel-skiing. I loved doing all these sports with my friends, however at the age of 16 I decided to stop competing. Since then, I still do a lot of sports but for my own pleasure. I continue downhill and cross-country skiing in the Winter as well as running and cycling in the Summer. But I also tried new sports that I liked a lot, such as triathlon, rowing 🚣🏽‍♀️, Touch Rugby 🏉 and Netball.

				<h2>Travels</h2>
				<p>
					I really love to travel. It is certainly my parents who passed on this passion to me. Indeed, we have always travelled and I am very grateful because I love discovering new landscapes, new cultures and new people. I had the chance to discover many countries, including Australia where I stayed for 10 months. I have travelled on the 5 continents of the globe and I still have this strong desire to discover the world, especially the American continent. Here is the list of the countries I have travelled to:
